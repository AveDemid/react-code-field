## Motivation

I tried many libraries of this kind, but they all had problems and I could not say that they were predictable.

I tried to fix all the basic errors and therefore you see this library here and it seems I did pretty well.

The library is still in alpha, but in the coming month I will bring it to the form "ready for production."

| Property           | Type     |
